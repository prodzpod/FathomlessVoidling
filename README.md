# Fathomless Voidling

A Work In Progress of a Voidling rework mod. Stats are currently Mithrix level so Voidling is an actual alt final boss and not a DPS check, will have stat configs on full release. There's a Deep Void portal on soup island (moon cauldrons) that will take you directly to Voidling if you don't want to fight Mithrix or spend coins.
